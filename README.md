# SnakesAllAround

A basic game built using PyGame. I added my own upgradations to the game. In the game you can play in two ways
  - Single Player
  - Multi Player
  
  ###Single Player
    While playing in this mode, the boundaries are activated and you loose when you strike the head to boundaries. Also, you get 5 points per collection.
  ###Multi player
    Multiple snakes if handled, fetches you double points than in single player. And in this mode, boundaries are deactivated.

When you begin the game, multiplayer mode begins and if one snake is not disturbed mode changes to single player.
